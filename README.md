# WeatherInfoPy
This Python script utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather information for a specified city. The user is prompted to input the city name, and the script makes an API request to retrieve data such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. The API key is stored in an environment variable for security purposes. The obtained data is then formatted and printed to the console, including the city name, date and time, temperature in Celsius, weather description, humidity percentage, and wind speed in kilometers per hour.

This script serves as a simple weather information tool that can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a standalone utility for checking the current weather in a particular city. Users can run the script, input the desired city, and receive real-time weather updates. It demonstrates the use of the requests library for API communication, handling JSON responses, and extracting relevant weather information.
